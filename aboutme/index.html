    <h2>Soren Petersen</h2>
    <p>Hello Fellow WWD 130 Participents!</p>
    <p>You may call me Soren. I currently live in Arizona with my best friend and beautiful wife Trisha, and our 3 girls ages 6, 4, and (currently) 5 months. We live on 3/4 of an acare with our 40 chickens and 2 dogs.</p>
    <p>I currently work in the IT field as a Systems Administrator, I have been working in IT since 1997 when I started my first business building and repairing computers. In May of 2020 I was in a work accident that caused a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) where I lost a significient portion of my IT skills and background knowledge. I am so grateful for this pathways program to help rebuild that lost knowledge and gain more.</p>
    <p>Majority of my time is spent with my family, at home, gaining knowledge, and also spent with my doctors for this new life long journey of recovery.</p>
